Wp FastClick plugin remove click delays on browsers with touch UIs.

== Description ==

This plugin uses fastclick.js[https://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/]

Why does the delay exist?

According to Google:

...mobile browsers will wait approximately 300ms from the time that you tap the button to fire the click event. The reason for this is that the browser is waiting to see if you are actually performing a double tap.
